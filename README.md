# Group project - Notes

Deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://iainaitken.github.io/notes-app/).

## Description

A single-page front-end vanilla JavaScript app for note taking.

### Project challenges

* To create a web app that only uses a single page.
* To do so without using any external libraries, such as jQuery or Jasmine.
* To develop the app in a TDD way, by creating our own test library in JavaScript.

I can use shortcodes like `:fire:` that get converted into emojis like ğŸ”¥

To delete all notes, click on "clear notes".

### Tests

* The javascript folder is divided into src and spec folders. 
* To run the tests, open tests.html from the javascript folder in your browser. This loads and runs both the src and spec files.
* Open the console to view pass and fail messages for the tests.
